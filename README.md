# Humanist Min

Humanist Min is a design language being developed by the team at Feathers Design. The language itself is open source and you can feel free to contribute or to use it in your own project. :bowtie:

> :exclamation: This is a very early work in progress and is a living document. Not recommended for use at all. :confused:

## What is Humanist Min

H-Min is a humanist take on modernist minimalism. While modernism definitely has its perks by putting function first, some would argue that it lacks humanism. It was strict and unforgiving. I was a staunch modernist for many years, while slowly maturing into a more humane, relatable designer. HumanistMin is the culmination of my experience, and it will keep developing.

## Roadmap

The Humanist Min manifesto is a living document. Here's the roadmap. This will be revised from time to time, or may be changed completely. Until we have at least a very preliminary draft, Humanist Min cannot be practically used anywhere. Several points *may* be pursued simultaneously on parallel threads. Note that some design disciplines like game design and automotive design have not yet been considered as part of H-Min. Whether the H-Min core can be applicable to such other fields will be left for later. Collaborators welcome.

**Currently working on:**

- [x] Define Humanist Min and core philosophy.
- [ ] Define recommended fonts and font combinations.
- [ ] Define recommended colors and color combinations or gradients.
- [ ] Basic geometry.
- [ ] Create UI and graphic framework.
- [ ] Create stylesheet (CSS).

**In future:**

- [ ] H-Min in motion graphics.
- [ ] What does H-Min mean beyond digital?
- [ ] H-Min in print design.
- [ ] H-Min in industrial design.
- [ ] H-Min in architecture and interior design.
- [ ] H-Min elsewhereâ€”textile, art.
